# node_with_chrome
A base image of node built on Ubuntu, along with the latest Chrome

I have used the first answer called-out in the link below, for bringing up this base image.
https://askubuntu.com/questions/510056/how-to-install-google-chrome

This is intended to be used as a base image for building and testing Angular applications within Docker.
This should help run both the Jasmine-based unit tests as well as the Protractor-based e2e tests.

The docker image is available in the following link:
